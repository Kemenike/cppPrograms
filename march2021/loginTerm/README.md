## Description
This code gives the user two options.
The first option is to register their login.
    This simply just creates a file with the username as the file name, and 
    the password is held within the file
The second option is to login, if they dont have a login they will be met with
an error message.
    All this option does is read the file to assertain the password. If they match
    it gives a congrats message. If not they have 3 attempts to get the correct
    password. After the three attemps they will be met with another error message.

## Installation
First install the register.exe then add a folder in the same directory
called "logins".
